# Bread & Roses
This project was created working with the [The ProPublica Congress API](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api) The idea of the project is to be a one-stop-shop for information on what our government is doing for workers.  There are pages for the Senate and House committees that deal with workers' issues, and this app provides a filterable list of members, complete with website links and contact info.  It also provides, for each committe, a list of the hearings their committee has had, and the House committee hearings, specifically, also provide links with transscripts to the testimonies heard during those hearings.
